The **core** element of any language model application is...the model. LangChain gives you the building blocks to interface with any language model.

- Prompts: ``Templatize``, dynamically select, and manage model inputs
- Language models: Make calls to language models through common interfaces
- Output parsers: Extract information from model outputs

Prompts
--------

A prompt for a language model is a set of instructions or input provided by a user to guide the model's response, helping it understand the context and generate relevant and coherent language-based output, such as answering questions, completing sentences, or engaging in a conversation.

LangChain provides several classes and functions to help construct and work with prompts.
